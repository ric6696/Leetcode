## About

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. This repository includes my solutions to a wide range of problems, categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and problem type (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, etc.). 

The goal is to build a solid foundation in algorithm design, problem-solving strategies, and coding practices while improving my speed and efficiency in solving algorithmic challenges.

## Problems Solved

I have solved a variety of problems from different topics on LeetCode. Some of the key categories include:
